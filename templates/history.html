         <li>Condensed and paraphrased from Wikipedia: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_potato"> URL</a> 
         </li>
         <p>Potatoes were originally domesticated as early as 2500 B.C. Potatoes were used by the Inca Empire (South America).</p>
         <p>The Columbian exchange past 1588, carried multiple goods from the American continent. One of this goods was the potato. </p>
         <p>The potato was a staple crop of Ireland many years after the Columbian Exchange. In 1845, potatoes were infested with a disease that ruined most of the crop. This event lasted 7 years.</p>
         <p>Nearly one million people left Ireland towards the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and elsewhere. Many irish communities can trace their origin to this diaspora.</p>
